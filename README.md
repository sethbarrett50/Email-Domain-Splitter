# Email-Domain-Splitter
This project takes a text file full of email addresses followed by a colon and a password, and searches through it to seperate emails by domain.
It does this by using regular expressions to identify email addresses, their domains, and the password.
It then sorts the emails and their associated passwords into separate text files named after the emailâ€™s domain, with all the emails of the same domain being sent to the same text file.
It then sends the output text files into a new zip file.

I'm pretty sure I can make this more efficent by only using one Regular Expression and just use grouping on it.
I hope to come back and improve on my work, but this works very nice right now.
